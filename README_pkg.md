# Welcome to DISROPT [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/disropt/badge/?version=latest)](https://disropt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
[**Reference docs**](https://disropt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

| [**Getting started**](#getting-started)

**DISROPT** is a Python package developed within the excellence research program ERC in the project [OPT4SMART](http://www.opt4smart.eu).
The aim of this package is to provide an easy way to run distributed optimization algorithms that can 
be executed by a network of peer computing systems.

A comprehensive guide to DISROPT can be found in the [documentation](https://disropt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
The package is equipped with some commonly used objective functions and constraints which can be directly used.
 
**DISROPT** currently supports MPI in order to emulate peer-to-peer communication. However, custom communication protocols can be also implemented.

## Installation
**DISROPT** works on Python 3.7 and requires an MPI implementation to be installed on your system.

It relies on

* numpy
* scipy
* mpi4py
* autograd
* osqp (optional, but required for some features)
* cvxopt (optional, but required for some features)
* cvxpy (optional, but required for some features)

### pip installation
```
pip install disropt
```
